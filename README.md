## About

- Java program that uses basic OOP principles, and los and displays information of a road trip on a minivan 

## Features

There are really no features
- Currently, there are plans to make a GUI, to not have to be depending on the terminal for user input.

## Prerequisites

- Any Code Editor
- I used VSCode and IntelliJ

## Installation

- Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mannyortiz478/RoadTrip-app.git
```
- Start a python virtual enviornment (make sure you are in the latest python version 3.9 or higher)
- then with the terminal in your IDE, run `python3 main.py`.

## Getting Started

If you are running on VSCode
- Open the terminal
- Compile the code with javac
```bash
javac App.java
```
- Then run the compiled Java code.
```bash
java App
```
- Or navigate to the app.js file
- Then at the top right corner click on the triangle/play button next the split editor button.

If running on IntelliJ
- Right-click anywhere in the editor or on the file in the Project Explorer.
- Select "Run 'app.main()'."

- Feel free to use any other method!
## Contributing
I did this myself, but I am open to contributing with others to leverage this application.
